# Galaga -- findings so far

`Galaga (NTSC) (Atari) (1987) (1A0A3EB3).a78`, 32K linear, no banking.
Everything below is reproducible with the
[a7800-toolkit](../../a7800-toolkit/README.md) against `annotations.json`
in this folder:

```
python3 ../a7800-toolkit/tools/disasm.py "Galaga (NTSC) (Atari) (1987) (1A0A3EB3).a78" -c annotations.json -o src
python3 ../a7800-toolkit/tools/verify.py "Galaga (NTSC) (Atari) (1987) (1A0A3EB3).a78" -d src
```

Static coverage from `tools/init.py`'s first pass (vectors only, no manual
work yet) is **35.9%** as traced code (11780/32768 bytes, 5482
instructions) -- a strong starting point, well above where the other three
projects in this series began. Round-trip is byte-identical.

Vectors: `NMI $B15D` `RESET $FF73` `IRQ $B610`.

## The size question, resolved immediately

Before any code was read, the open question from picking this project was
why a 32K image would declare mapper flags of `$0000` -- the same "nothing
special" value a plain 16K cart uses. `tools/init.py` resolved it in one
run, correctly, with no manual digging needed: the 7800's own address bus
gives `$8000`-`$FFFF` as a full 32K window, so a 32K ROM fits there
*linearly*, no bank-switching hardware required at all. The sibling
projects (Centipede, Ballblazer, Dig Dug) are all 16K carts that happen to
map into the *upper* half of that same window (`$C000`-`$FFFF`); Galaga
just uses the whole thing. Not a lying header, not a bug -- the question
just had a simpler answer than the two live disassembly projects before
it, both 16K, had trained an expectation around.

## Methodology note

A privately-held, unlicensed historical source for this game exists (see
`README.md`). Deliberately not consulted yet, on the user's explicit
instruction -- the plan is to get substantially through this project's own
independent work first, then cross-check once, the same way Dig Dug's
cross-check was done, but without any earlier peek that could have steered
what got looked for. Whatever agrees or disagrees will be written up
honestly either way, per this whole series' standing discipline: never
quote or copy the reference in, never let it override live-verified
evidence from this project's own ROM, and treat disagreement as data
rather than an error to resolve in either direction.

## What's still open

Everything. This is the `init.py` baseline, not a finding -- the next
steps are the same as every previous project in this series: survey the
gap list, name the two or three biggest data/graphics regions, and find a
concrete, checkable gameplay hook (a score display, a lives counter, a
clearly-timed event) to anchor the first live probe.
